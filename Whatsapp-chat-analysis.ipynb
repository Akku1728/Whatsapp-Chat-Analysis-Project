      "The first round was an online round.\n",
      "\n",
      "It consisted of 45 questions and the time allotted was 60 minutes. The questions were not very tough but time was the major constraint here. You need to be 100 percent focused and refrain from making any calculation errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The test was MCQ type and questions were asked from Verbal Ability, Logical Reasoning, Data Sufficiency, Data Redundancy, Data Interpretation and Quantitative Aptitude. You should try to get through with the Verbal Ability and the Logical Reasoning sections as fast as possible, so that you can have sufficient time for the rest, since the questions were quite time consuming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This round was the main eliminating round and around 30 out of around 400 students were called for round 2.\n",

      "\n",
      "In this round both HR as well as technical questions were asked. All you need to do is answer all their questions confidently and you should be through. There were 2 panelists and they were very friendly and they helped me out if I was unaware of anything they asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can divide the questions asked to me into 3 broad categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Technical: They asked me about my favorite subject. I chose Digital Electronics and hence a few elementary questions from there which I was able to answer easily. Then they asked me a few questions related to basic programming techniques. For example, the advantages of Vector over Array, try-catch-finally in Java, basic searching/sorting techniques and basic OOP principles. You need to have basic programming knowledge since most of the candidates there were asked similar questions. If you don’t know the answer to a particular question, admit it, instead of giving a vague answer. They are looking for a confident approach to a question more than a correct answer.\n",
      "HR: I would call this part more of a casual conversation rather than an interview. They asked me about my hobbies and extra-academic interests, how I manage time for my interests alongside studies, about my family, hometown, schooling, college life, etc. Just answer their questions confidently and you should be fine.\n",
      "Company Specific: They asked me what I knew about PWC. I really wanted to get into a consulting firm so obviously, I had quite an idea of what PWC was. Apart from that, why I wanted to choose consulting as an career instead of a technical firm and what made me fit to be a good consultant. My suggestion would be, research a bit about the company before you go in for their interview and this stands for other interviews as well. Letting the interviewers know that you are genuinely interested goes a long way.\n",
      "This was all about the 2nd round. Around 15 people cleared this and were called for the 3rd round.\n",
      "\n",
      "Round 3:(HR Interview)\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing technical was asked in this round.\n",
      "\n",
      "This round was more of confirming if I was suitable for the job. They asked me if I was comfortable with traveling since the job demanded frequent traveling. Whether or not I was planning about further studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was a short interview and in the end I had to fill up a form in which I had to state my preference of location as well as some other personal information.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was about it. In about 2 hours the results were declared and 10 students were selected.\n",

      "• Allow 6-month internships: Many companies, including Amazon and ZS Associates, demands 6-month internships and promise to offer PPOs. Consider making 6-month internships in the current college placement season(it is also included in architecture department we should look after it too).\n",
      "• Implement a phase system: Group companies into phases based on their recruitment timelines (e.g., October-December). Provide students with a list of companies and their corresponding phases for better preparation.\n",
      "• Revise CTC categories: Update the CTC category system to:\n",
      "\t• Category A: Up to 6 lakhs\n",
      "\t• Category B: Up to 13 lakhs\n",
      "• Establish a Campus Ambassador program: Assign a Campus Ambassadors for the particular company. He/she could me on from any department from the final batch. Empower them to address student queries directly with companies' placement coordinator.\n",
      "• Allow leave for placement activities: Grant students leave for written tests, interviews, and presentations. Most of the professors do not grant leave telling that it's your personal concern.  Ensure professors do not deduct attendance for these activities.\n",

Let me take an example, if the company is giving 4.5 lpa and it's blocking the whole category B ( 4-10 lpa) I think it's totally unethical as we all are from Institute of national importance and having jobs of just 4.5 lpa in our hands. Category B is the most crucial category, the difference between the end points of it is very much. So according to me it should be revised so at least some one can get a decent package and have a chance to sit for the next category.\n",

       " 'Protik Saha Palash CE IIEST: Round 1 : (Online)\\n\\nThe first round was an online round.\\n\\nIt consisted of 45 questions and the time allotted was 60 minutes. The questions were not very tough but time was the major constraint here. You need to be 100 percent focused and refrain from making any calculation errors.\\n\\nThe test was MCQ type and questions were asked from Verbal Ability, Logical Reasoning, Data Sufficiency, Data Redundancy, Data Interpretation and Quantitative Aptitude. You should try to get through with the Verbal Ability and the Logical Reasoning sections as fast as possible, so that you can have sufficient time for the rest, since the questions were quite time consuming.\\n\\n\\nThis round was the main eliminating round and around 30 out of around 400 students were called for round 2.\\n\\nRound 2:(Interview)\\n\\nIn this round both HR as well as technical questions were asked. All you need to do is answer all their questions confidently and you should be through. There were 2 panelists and they were very friendly and they helped me out if I was unaware of anything they asked.\\n\\nI can divide the questions asked to me into 3 broad categories.\\n\\nTechnical: They asked me about my favorite subject. I chose Digital Electronics and hence a few elementary questions from there which I was able to answer easily. Then they asked me a few questions related to basic programming techniques. For example, the advantages of Vector over Array, try-catch-finally in Java, basic searching/sorting techniques and basic OOP principles. You need to have basic programming knowledge since most of the candidates there were asked similar questions. If you don’t know the answer to a particular question, admit it, instead of giving a vague answer. They are looking for a confident approach to a question more than a correct answer.\\nHR: I would call this part more of a casual conversation rather than an interview. They asked me about my hobbies and extra-academic interests, how I manage time for my interests alongside studies, about my family, hometown, schooling, college life, etc. Just answer their questions confidently and you should be fine.\\nCompany Specific: They asked me what I knew about PWC. I really wanted to get into a consulting firm so obviously, I had quite an idea of what PWC was. Apart from that, why I wanted to choose consulting as an career instead of a technical firm and what made me fit to be a good consultant. My suggestion would be, research a bit about the company before you go in for their interview and this stands for other interviews as well. Letting the interviewers know that you are genuinely interested goes a long way.\\nThis was all about the 2nd round. Around 15 people cleared this and were called for the 3rd round.\\n\\nRound 3:(HR Interview)\\n\\nNothing technical was asked in this round.\\n\\nThis round was more of confirming if I was suitable for the job. They asked me if I was comfortable with traveling since the job demanded frequent traveling. Whether or not I was planning about further studies.\\n\\nThis was a short interview and in the end I had to fill up a form in which I had to state my preference of location as well as some other personal information.\\n\\nThis was about it. In about 2 hours the results were declared and 10 students were selected.\\n',\n",
