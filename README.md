# PROJECT BRIEF: Chat Analysis Project:

## Objective:

The project focuses on processing and analyzing text data from WhatsApp chat logs or similar text-based sources. The key objective is to clean and preprocess the data, transforming raw, unstructured information into a structured format that can be used for further analysis or insights and visual representations like pie chat, bar chart, heatmap, activity charts etc.

## Tools used:
- PyCharm : to run python codes
- Jupyter Notebook : to test codes

## Libraries used:
-	Streamlit : used for creating interactive web application, data uploading and processing, visualizing insights, text analytics interface etc these kind of tasks.
-	Pandas : used for creating and manipulating data in a structured format, specifically in the form of DataFrames. It assists with converting dates, extracting time-based features, and organizing chat data for further analysis.
-	Matplotlib : used in this file to create various visualizations of chat data, including timelines, bar charts, and pie charts
-	Seaborn : used for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics, mainly the heatmap that was implemented in the project
-	URLExtract : used to extract URLs from text messages
-	WordCloud : used to create a visual representation of word frequency in chat messages, generating an image where more common words appear larger.
-	Emoji : used to identify and extract emojis from chat messages, allowing for the creation of a frequency count of emojis used in the conversation
-	Re : Used for pattern matching and splitting text in the preprocessor.py file. It helps extract timestamps, users, and messages from raw chat data by identifying specific patterns.
-	Counter : used to efficiently count occurrences of words and emojis in chat messages, simplifying the process of identifying and ranking the most frequently used elements in the conversation.

## General Approach: 
This project aims to analyze WhatsApp chat data, providing insights into messaging patterns, user activity, and content trends. It uses Python for data processing and analysis, and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application to visualize the results.

## Step-by-step process:
### 1.	Data Preprocessing: 
-	Import chat data from a file
-	Parse and structure the raw data into a pandas DataFrame
-	Extract relevant information like date, time, user, and message content
### 2.	Feature Engineering: 
-	Create additional time-based features (year, month, day, hour)
-	Categorize messages (text, media, links)
-.	Data Analysis: 
-	Calculate basic statistics (total messages, words, media shared, links)
-	Analyze user activity patterns
-	Perform text analysis (most common words, emojis)
-	Create time-based visualizations (daily and monthly timelines)
### 4.	Visualization: 
-	Generate various charts and graphs using matplotlib and seaborn
-	Create a word cloud for frequently used terms
### 5.	Web Application Development: 
-	Design the user interface using Streamlit
-	Implement user selection for specific analysis (overall or per-user)
-	Integrate data processing and visualization components
### 6.	App Deployment: 
-	Since weâ€™ve used streamlit so we deployed the web app on streamlit platform and we got a working link for the app that can be accessed from any platform/devices.

## The purpose and use of this project are:

1. Data Insights: To provide users with meaningful insights into their WhatsApp conversations, helping them understand communication patterns and trends.

2. User Behaviour Analysis: To analyze individual and group messaging habits, identifying the most active users and peak communication times.

3. Content Analysis: To examine the most frequently used words and emojis, giving users a snapshot of common topics and sentiment in their chats.

4. Time-based Trends: To visualize messaging activity over time, allowing users to identify patterns in daily and monthly communication.

5. Media Usage Tracking: To quantify the amount of media (images, videos, stickers) and links shared, providing insight into how information is exchanged.

6. Group Dynamics: For group chats, to help understand the participation levels of different members and overall group activity patterns.

7. Personal Reflection: To allow individuals to reflect on their own communication habits and potentially identify areas for improvement or change.

8. Research Tool: To serve as a potential tool for researchers studying digital communication patterns and social media behavior.

9. Business Intelligence: For businesses using WhatsApp, to analyze customer communication patterns and improve engagement strategies.

10. Educational Use: As a learning tool for data analysis and visualization techniques using real-world data.

This project can be particularly useful for individuals curious about their digital communication habits, social media managers analyzing group interactions, researchers studying online communication, and anyone interested in gaining insights from their WhatsApp chat data in a user-friendly, visual format.



## Conclusion: 
This WhatsApp Chat Analyzer provides a comprehensive tool for users to gain insights from their chat data. It offers a user-friendly interface to explore messaging patterns, identify active users, and visualize communication trends over time.


## Recommendations:
1.	Implement multi-language support for broader usability
2.	Enhance privacy measures to ensure sensitive information is not exposed
3.	Optimize the application for handling larger datasets and improve processing speed
4.	Add export functionality for generated insights and visualizations
